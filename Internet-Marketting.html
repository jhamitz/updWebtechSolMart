<b>Boom!</b> In a microsecond, Google will do a million things all at once including: pulling historical data, checking cookies, looking at personalization factors, determining your location based on IP, Wi-Fi or GPS data… and oh yeah, they’ll also use their totally awesome algorithm to understand the intent behind your search query, “widgets near me.”<br/>
<b>Then, in a blink of an eye…</b> A search results page appears! You instinctively click the top result and find a local seller of widgets. Conveniently. Near. You.<br/>
<b>…and that my friend, is the magic of local SEO.</b> It’s all about providing the necessary information to Google (and other search engines) to match your local business to people searching for the products and services you offer at the exact moment they’re searching for it.</p>
